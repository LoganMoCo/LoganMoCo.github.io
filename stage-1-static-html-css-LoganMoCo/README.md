## Project Title: Henry Heat

### Project Overview

Henry Heat is a web application designed to document and share hot sauce recipes, ingredients, and equipment. It aims to guide users in creating their own hot sauce recipes by providing detailed information on various components. The site will feature sections for recipes, ingredients, preservatives, equipment, and a recipe inspiration generator.

### Stage 1: Basic HTML + CSS

#### Requirements

For this stage, you will create a static mockup of your website using HTML and CSS. The goal is to design a visually appealing and well-structured layout that represents the core sections of your project. This version will be completely static and non-interactive.

#### Deliverables

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Create an `index.html` file.
   - Include the following sections:
     - **Header**: Title of the website (e.g., "Henry Heat").
     - **Navigation Bar**: Links to different sections (e.g., Recipes, Ingredients, Equipment).
     - **Main Content Area**: 
       - Placeholder for a featured recipe with a title and description.
       - Sections for Ingredients, Equipment, and Recipe Inspiration.
     - **Footer**: Contact information or a brief about section.

2. **CSS Styling**
   - Create a `style.css` file.
   - Use CSS to style the layout, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
   - Implement a color scheme that reflects the theme of hot sauce (e.g., warm colors like red, orange, yellow).
   - Use Flexbox or Grid for layout to ensure sections are well-organized.

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the website is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy your static site using a platform like GitHub Pages.
   - Include the deployment link in this README.

#### Additional Comments

- Focus on creating a clean and intuitive design that highlights the different sections of your website.
- Use placeholder text and images where necessary to represent future content.
- This stage is about visual presentation and layout, so no JavaScript or interactivity is required at this point.

#### Submission

- Ensure your project is deployed and accessible via the provided link.
- Submit your project repository with the `index.html`, `style.css`, and this `README.md` file.
