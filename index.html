        <h1>About Henry Heat</h1>
        The story of Henry Heat begins with a hot sauce making kit and a book of recipes. At fifteen years old I recieved the kit for Christmas. I ony followed one recipe from it, then I began to experiment. Henry Heat has everything anyone would want in hot sauce. We have recipes for basic sauce like garlic jalepeno and apple cayenne, but we also have some that make us different than other brands, like coffee and scorpion chilis or watermelon tabasco. This website documents the process behind hot sauce making, along with ingredients, and inspiration for recipes. Thanks for visiting!
